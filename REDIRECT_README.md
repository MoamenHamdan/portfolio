   ```
2. Or use the inline version in your HTML head:
   ```html
   <script>
   // Copy the content of redirect.js here
   </script>
   ```

## üì± Testing Your Redirect

1. **Test locally**: Open the files in your browser

4. **Test different browsers**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge

## üîß Customization

### Change Redirect URL
In any of the files, replace:
```
https://moamenhamdanportfolio.web.app/
```
with your new URL.

### Change Redirect Delay
- `redirect.html`: Change `content="5;url=..."` in meta tag
